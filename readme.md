# Progress.js

Find out your progress on a page with JavaScript. Progress.js works out where you are on a page, as a percentage. Scroll to the top, you're at 0% progress. Scroll to the bottom, you're at 100%.

Use the progress value to execute code based on where your user is on a page.

Requires jQuery.
